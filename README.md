Title: Child and Women Safety Devices

Authors: T. Tejarani, Y. Bhaskar Rao

Journal: International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation

ISSN: 1475-7192

Publication Year: 2020

Technology Focus:

RSS (Received Signal Strength)

MEMS sensors

Wearable IoT

Wireless Indoor Localization

Arduino-based monitoring systems

📄 Abstract

The project focuses on ensuring child and women safety using Received Signal Strength (RSS) instead of GPS to reduce cost and increase indoor tracking efficiency. The proposed system monitors movement through RSS-based localization and triggers alerts when critical conditions are detected. Wearable sensor modules like MEMS help detect potential danger signals, and notifications are sent to parents or guardians.
